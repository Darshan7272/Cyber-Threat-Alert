# Cyber-Threat-Alert
With drastic developments in the field of the internet and its technology, attacks on the systems are also increasing. The organisations are implimenting various techniques and measures to protext thier intangible assets, i.e, the data.
One of the technique is to predict the type of attack using the Machine Learning algorithms and prevent the attack happening. 
   This project consists of two kinds of classifications of the attacks; Binomial: Detects the activity is normal or not. Multinomial: Not only detects the activity is abnormal but also classifies the type of attack done on the system.
   Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Ensemble Models are used to build the model to detect the type of the activity and alert the cybersecurity team to take the preventive meassures.
